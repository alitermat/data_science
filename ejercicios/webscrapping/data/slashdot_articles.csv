Mr. Cooper Hackers Stole Personal Data on 14 Million Customers  (techcrunch.com),https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/mr-cooper-hackers-stole-personal-data-on-14-million-customers/,"Hackers stole the sensitive personal information of more than 14.6 million Mr. Cooper customers, the mortgage and loan giant has confirmed. From a report: In a filing with Maine's attorney general's office, Mr. Cooper said the hackers stole customer names, addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers, as well as customer Social Security numbers and bank account numbers. Mr. Cooper previously said that customer banking information was stored by a third-party company and believed to be unaffected. Mr. Cooper said in a separate filing with federal regulators on Friday that hackers obtained personal data on ""substantially all of our current and former customers."" 

The number of affected victims is significantly higher than the four million existing customers that Mr. Cooper claims on its website, likely because of the historical data that the company stores on mortgage holders. Mr. Cooper said in its data breach notification letter to affected victims that the stolen data includes personal information on those whose mortgage was previously acquired or serviced by the company when it was known as Nationstar Mortgage, prior to its rebranding as Mr. Cooper. The company said affected customers may include those whose mortgages were serviced by a sister brand.","on Monday December 18, 2023 @02:20PM"
OpenAI Lays Out Plan For Dealing With Dangers of AI  (washingtonpost.com),https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/18/open-ai-preparedness-bioweapons-madry/,"OpenAI, the AI company behind ChatGPT, laid out its plans for staying ahead of what it thinks could be serious dangers of the tech it develops, such as allowing bad actors to learn how to build chemical and biological weapons. From a report: OpenAI's ""Preparedness"" team, led by MIT AI professor Aleksander Madry, will hire AI researchers, computer scientists, national security experts and policy professionals to monitor its tech, continually test it and warn the company if it believes any of its AI capabilities are becoming dangerous. The team sits between OpenAI's ""Safety Systems"" team, which works on existing problems like infusing racist biases into AI, and the company's ""Superalignment"" team, which researches how to make sure AI doesn't harm humans in an imagined future where the tech has outstripped human intelligence completely. 

[...] Madry, a veteran AI researcher who directs MIT's Center for Deployable Machine Learning and co-leads the MIT AI Policy Forum, joined OpenAI earlier this year. He was one of a small group of OpenAI leaders who quit when Altman was fired by the company's board in November. Madry returned to the company when Altman was reinstated five days later. OpenAI, which is governed by a nonprofit board whose mission is to advance AI and make it helpful for all humans, is in the midst of selecting new board members after three of the four board members who fired Altman stepped down as part of his return. Despite the leadership ""turbulence,"" Madry said he believes OpenAI's board takes seriously the risks of AI that he is researching. ""I realized if I really want to shape how AI is impacting society, why not go to a company that is actually doing it?""","on Monday December 18, 2023 @01:40PM"
Imran Khan Deploys AI Clone To Campaign From Behind Bars in Pakistan  (theguardian.com),https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/18/imran-khan-deploys-ai-clone-to-campaign-from-behind-bars-in-pakistan,"AI allowed Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan to campaign from behind bars on Monday, with a voice clone of the opposition leader giving an impassioned speech on his behalf. From a report: Khan has been locked up since August and is being tried for leaking classified documents, allegations he says have been trumped up to stop him contesting general elections due in February. His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party used artificial intelligence to make a four-minute message from the 71-year-old, headlining a ""virtual rally"" hosted on social media overnight on Sunday into Monday despite internet disruptions that monitor NetBlocks said were consistent with previous attempts to censor Khan. 

PTI said Khan sent a shorthand script through lawyers that was fleshed out into his rhetorical style. The text was then dubbed into audio using a tool from the AI firm ElevenLabs, which boasts the ability to create a ""voice clone"" from existing speech samples. ""My fellow Pakistanis, I would first like to praise the social media team for this historic attempt,"" the voice mimicking Khan said. ""Maybe you all are wondering how I am doing in jail,"" the stilted voice adds. ""Today, my determination for real freedom is very strong."" The audio was broadcast at the end of a five-hour live-stream of speeches by PTI supporters on Facebook, X and YouTube, and was overlaid with historic footage of Khan and still images.","on Monday December 18, 2023 @01:00PM"
US Lawmakers Warn Biden To Probe EU Targeting of Tech Firms  (yahoo.com),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-us-lawmakers-urge-biden-154416105.html,"A bipartisan group of lawmakers has written to U.S. President Joe Biden, warning European technology regulation are unfairly targeting U.S. companies and not including many Chinese or EU firms, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday. From the report: Under the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), five major U.S. tech companies -- Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft -- were designated ""gatekeeper"" service providers. From March 2024, these companies -- as well as TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance -- will be required to make their messaging apps work with rivals and let users choose which ones they want pre-installed on their devices.  

In a letter seen by Reuters, 21 members of the U.S. House of Representatives warned the new rules could damage American economic and security interests and called on Biden to secure commitments from the EU the rules will be enforced fairly. ""Securing our leadership in this sector is imperative for our economy and American workers,"" the letter said. ""The designation of leading U.S. companies as 'gatekeepers' threatens to upend the U.S. economy, diminish our global leadership in the digital sphere, and jeopardize the security of consumers."" 

The letter questioned why Chinese companies Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent had avoided designation and why European companies had avoided any scrutiny. ""The EU inexplicably failed to designate any European retailers, content-sharing platforms, payment firms, and telcos,"" it said. Signatories of the letter -- including Representative Lou Correa, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, -- called on Biden to seek assurances from EU lawmakers the DMA will not be unfairly used to target U.S. companies.","on Monday December 18, 2023 @12:20PM"
Lawmakers Push DOJ To Investigate Apple Following Beeper Shutdowns  (theverge.com),https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/18/24006037/apple-beeper-doj-investigation-imessage-letter-android,"Following a tumultuous few weeks for Beeper, which has been trying to provide an iMessage-compatible Android app, a group of US lawmakers are pushing for the DOJ to investigate Apple for ""potentially anticompetitive conduct"" over its attempts to disable Beeper's services. From a report: Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) as well as Representatives Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Ken Buck (R-CO) said in a letter to the DOJ that Beeper's Android messaging app, Beeper Mini, was a threat to Apple's leverage by ""creating [a] more competitive mobile applications market, which in turn [creates] a more competitive mobile device market."" 

In an interview with CBS News on Monday, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky and 16-year-old developer James Gill talked about the fight to keep Beeper Mini alive. Migicovsky told CBS News that Beeper is trying to provide a service people want and reiterated his belief that Apple has a monopoly over its iMessage service. The company created Beeper Mini after being contacted by Gill, who said he reverse-engineered the software by ""poking at it"" using a ""real Mac and a real iPhone."" [...] The lawmakers' letter also pointed to a Department of Commerce report calling Apple a ""gatekeeper,"" mirroring language used in the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) that went into force earlier this year, regulating the ""core"" services of several tech platforms (though, notably, iMessage may not be included in this). They went on to cite Migicovsky's December 2021 Senate Judiciary Committee testimony that ""the dominant messaging services would use their position to impose barriers to interoperability"" and keep companies like Beeper from offering certain services. ""Given Apple's recent actions, that concern appears prescient,"" they added.","on Monday December 18, 2023 @11:40AM"
Southwest Will Pay a $140 Million Fine For Its Meltdown During the 2022 Holidays,,"Southwest Airlines is still paying for its meltdown during the 2022 holidays that stranded millions of travelers -- and the tab is growing. From a report: The U.S. Transportation Department has ordered Southwest to pay a $140 million civil penalty, part of a broader consent order after the airline's operational failures a year ago. That penalty is by far the largest the DOT has ever levied for consumer protection violations, according to a statement from the department. ""This is not just about Southwest,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition on Monday. ""This is about the entire industry, sending a signal that you should not be cutting corners -- because if you fail your passengers, we will hold you accountable."" 

A major winter storm last December caused travel disruptions across the country as airlines canceled thousands of flights. But while other airlines recovered relatively quickly, Southwest fell apart. The airline ultimately canceled 16,900 flights, stranding more than 2 million passengers. In a statement, Southwest described the agreement as ""a consumer-friendly settlement."" The airline says it has taken steps since last year's disruption to improve its operational resiliency and customer care.","on Monday December 18, 2023 @11:00AM"
Documents Reveal Hidden Problems at Russia's Nuclear Powerhouse,,"An anonymous reader shares a report: As Russian troops poured into Ukraine at the start of Vladimir Putin's invasion in February last year, alarm was rising at a flagship Kremlin nuclear project in neighboring Belarus, just a short distance from the European Union's border. Engineers at Rosatom preparing a new 1,200-megawatt reactor, which was not yet connected to the power grid, to generate electricity at the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant detected a mysterious and exceedingly rare problem. Resin was seeping into the primary circuit, threatening to seize up critical components, according to internal documents of the Russian state nuclear corporation seen by Bloomberg. 

Control rods and fuel assemblies risked being damaged or broken if the problem persisted when uranium atoms began fissioning. In the worst case, according to people familiar with the problem, accumulation of so-called ion-exchange resin, which regulates the purity of water flowing through plant channels and pipes, could impede reactor control, elevating the risk of a meltdown if something went wrong once it was online. So on February 25, 2022, Rosatom pulled the plug temporarily on its freshly fueled unit in northwest Belarus, delaying its launch. 

Nuclear engineers said Rosatom followed safety procedures by interrupting physical startup of the reactor in order to investigate. Still, the problem compounded delays that pushed back commercial operations more than a year. When the reactor was turned on for the first time in March, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko confirmed there were problems to state media. ""There were certain shortcomings in the construction,"" he said. ""The delay is due to our determination to stick to very high safety standards."" The water contamination incident, which was previously flagged by Lithuanian intelligence, is among a series of problems, including shortages of skilled labor, delayed shipments, and defective supplies, that Rosatom faced in recent years and which have continued in the wake of Putin's war against Ukraine, according to the documents and interviews with European officials familiar with the assessments.","on Monday December 18, 2023 @10:20AM"
Deloitte Is Looking To AI To Help Avoid Mass Layoffs in Future  (bloomberg.com),https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-17/ai-could-be-helping-deloitte-avoid-mass-layoffs-in-the-future,"The giants of the consulting world face an unusual quandary this year: many of them are in the process of dismissing hundreds of staffers even after they hired thousands of college graduates to deal with new demand. Now, one of the biggest of them all is looking to AI to change that. From a report: Deloitte is using AI to evaluate existing staffers' skills and map out plans that would shift employees away from quieter parts of the business and into roles that are more in demand. It's part of a broader bet by the professional services firm that the technology will allow it to moderate hiring growth over time. 

The moves come after Deloitte added 130,000 staffers this year. But in the midst of those hirings, though, the firm warned thousands of staffers in the US and UK that their jobs were at risk of becoming redundant after the company was forced to restructure certain areas of the business in response to a slowdown in demand.

2023's Online 'Advent Calendars' Challenge Programmers With Tips and Puzzles,,"It's a geek tradition that started online back in 2000.  Programming language ""advent calendars"" offer daily tips about a programming language (if not a Christmas-themed programming puzzle) -- one a day through December 25th.

Does Meta's New Face Camera Herald a New Age of Surveillance?  Or Distraction...  (seattletimes.com),https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/ray-ban-meta-review-how-metas-new-face-camera-heralds-a-new-age-of-surveillance/,"""For the past two weeks, I've been using a new camera to secretly snap photos and record videos of strangers in parks, on trains, inside stores and at restaurants,"" writes a reporter for the New York Times. They were testing the recently released $300 Ray-Ban Meta glasses — ""I promise it was all in the name of journalism"" — which also includes microphones (and speakers, for listening to audio). 

They call the device ""part of a broader ambition in Silicon Valley to shift computing away from smartphone and computer screens and toward our faces.""

Meta, Apple and Magic Leap have all been hyping mixed-reality headsets that use cameras to allow their software to interact with objects in the real world. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg posted a video on Instagram demonstrating how the smart glasses could use AI to scan a shirt and help him pick out a pair of matching pants. Wearable face computers, the companies say, could eventually change the way we live and work... While I was impressed with the comfortable, stylish design of the glasses, I felt bothered by the implications for our privacy... 

To inform people that they are being photographed, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses include a tiny LED light embedded in the right frame to indicate when the device is recording. When a photo is snapped, it flashes momentarily. When a video is recording, it is continuously illuminated.  As I shot 200 photos and videos with the glasses in public, including on BART trains, on hiking trails and in parks, no one looked at the LED light or confronted me about it. And why would they? It would be rude to comment on a stranger's glasses, let alone stare at them... [A] Meta spokesperson, said the company took privacy seriously and designed safety measures, including a tamper-detection technology, to prevent users from covering up the LED light with tape. 
But another concern was how smart glasses might impact our ability to focus:

Even when I wasn't using any of the features, I felt distracted while wearing them...  I had problems concentrating while driving a car or riding a scooter. Not only was I constantly bracing myself for opportunities to shoot video, but the reflection from other car headlights emitted a harsh, blue strobe effect through the eyeglass lenses. Meta's safety manual for the Ray-Bans advises people to stay focused while driving, but it doesn't mention the glare from headlights. While doing work on a computer, the glasses felt unnecessary because there was rarely anything worth photographing at my desk, but a part of my mind constantly felt preoccupied by the possibility... 
Ben Long, a photography teacher in San Francisco, said he was skeptical about the premise of the Meta glasses helping people remain present.  ""If you've got the camera with you, you're immediately not in the moment,"" he said. ""Now you're wondering, Is this something I can present and record?"" 


The reporter admits they'll fondly cherish its photos of their dog [including in the original article], but ""the main problem is that the glasses don't do much we can't already do with phones... while these types of moments are truly precious, that benefit probably won't be enough to convince a vast majority of consumers to buy smart glasses and wear them regularly, given the potential costs of lost privacy and distraction.""","on Monday December 18, 2023 @04:34AM"
Creator of JSON Unveils New Programming Language 'Misty'  (crockford.com),https://www.crockford.com/misty/introduction.html,"He specified the JSON notation, and developed tools like JSLint and the minifier JSMin. His Wikipedia entry says he was also a senior JavaScript architect at PayPal — but he's probably better known for writing O'Reilly's book JavaScript: the Good Parts. 

But Doug Crockford has a new challenge.  O'Reilly's monthly tech newsletter says Crockford ""has created a new programming language called Misty. It is designed to be used both by students and professional programmers."" 

The language's official site calls it ""a dynamic, general-purpose, transitional, actor language. It has a gentle syntax that is intended to benefit students, as well as advanced features such as capability security and lambdas with lexical scoping...""
 The language is quite strict in its use of spaces and indentation. In most programming languages, code spacing and formatting are underspecified, which leads to many incompatible conventions of style, some promoting bug formation, and all promoting time-wasting arguments, incompatibilities, and hurt feelings. Misty instead allows only one convention which is strictly enforced. This liberates programmers to focus their attention on more important matters. 

Indentation is in increments of 4 spaces. The McKeeman Form is extended by three special rules to make this possible:  


indentation
The spaces required by the current nesting.  


increase_indentation
Append four spaces to the indentation.  


decrease_indentation
Remove four spaces from the indentation.   


The indentation is the number of spaces required at the beginning of a line as determined by its nesting level.   


indent
increase_indentation linebreak  


outdent
decrease_indentation linebreak   


The linebreak rule allows the insertion of a comment, ends the line, and checks the indentation of the next line. Multiple comments and blank lines may appear wherever a line can end.","on Monday December 18, 2023 @01:44AM"
ProPublica Argues US Police 'Have Undermined the Promise of Body Cameras'  (propublica.org),https://www.propublica.org/article/how-police-undermined-promise-body-cameras,"A new investigation from ProPublica argues that in the U.S., ""Hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars have been spent on what was sold as a revolution in transparency and accountability.  

""Instead, police departments routinely refuse to release footage...""


The technology represented the largest new investment in policing in a generation.  Yet without deeper changes, it was a fix bound to fall far short of those hopes. In every city, the police ostensibly report to mayors and other elected officials. But in practice, they have been given wide latitude to run their departments as they wish and to police — and protect — themselves. And so as policymakers rushed to equip the police with cameras, they often failed to grapple with a fundamental question: Who would control the footage? 

Instead, they defaulted to leaving police departments, including New York's, with the power to decide what is recorded, who can see it and when. In turn, departments across the country have routinely delayed releasing footage, released only partial or redacted video or refused to release it at all. They have frequently failed to discipline or fire officers when body cameras document abuse and have kept footage from the agencies charged with investigating police misconduct.  Even when departments have stated policies of transparency, they don't always follow them. Three years ago, after George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police officers and amid a wave of protests against police violence, the New York Police Department said it would publish footage of so-called critical incidents ""within 30 days."" There have been 380 such incidents since then. The department has released footage within a month just twice. 

And the department often does not release video at all. There have been 28 shootings of civilians this year by New York officers (through the first week of December). The department has released footage in just seven of these cases (also through the first week of December) and has not done so in any of the last 16....  For a snapshot of disclosure practices across the country, we conducted a review of civilians killed by police officers in June 2022, roughly a decade after the first body cameras were rolled out. We counted 79 killings in which there was body-worn-camera footage. A year and a half later, the police have released footage in just 33 cases — or about 42%. 

The reporting reveals that without further intervention from city, state and federal officials and lawmakers, body cameras may do more to serve police interests than those of the public they are sworn to protect...  The pattern has become so common across the country — public talk of transparency followed by a deliberate undermining of the stated goal — that the policing-oversight expert Hans Menos, who led Philadelphia's civilian police-oversight board until 2020, coined a term for it: the ""body-cam head fake.""  
The article includes examples where when footage was ultimately released, it contradicted initial police accounts. 

In one instance, past footage of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin ""was left in the control of a department where impunity reigned..."" the article points out, adding that Minneapolis ""fought against releasing the videos, even after Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal civil rights violations.""","on Sunday December 17, 2023 @10:53PM"
'Copyright Troll' Porn Company 'Makes Millions By Shaming Porn Consumers'  (yahoo.com),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-porn-company-makes-millions-110000970.html,"In 1999 Los Angeles Times reporter Michael Hiltzik co-authored a Pulitzer Prize-winning story. Now a business columnist for the Times, he writes that a Southern California maker of pornographic films named Strike 3 Holdings is also ""a copyright troll,"" according to U.S. Judge Royce C. Lamberth:

 Lamberth cwrote in 2018, ""Armed with hundreds of cut-and-pasted complaints and boilerplate discovery motions, Strike 3 floods this courthouse (and others around the country) with lawsuits smacking of extortion.    It treats this Court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM."" He likened its litigation strategy to a ""high-tech shakedown.""   Lamberth was not speaking off the cuff. Since September 2017, Strike 3 has filed more than 12,440 lawsuits in federal courts alleging that defendants infringed its copyrights by downloading its movies via BitTorrent, an online service on which unauthorized content can be accessed by almost anyone with a computer and internet connection. 
That includes 3,311 cases the firm filed this year, more than 550 in federal courts in California. On some days, scores of filings reach federal courthouses — on Nov. 17, to select a date at random, the firm filed 60 lawsuits nationwide...  Typically, they are settled for what lawyers say are cash payments in the four or five figures or are dismissed outright... 

It's impossible to pinpoint the profits that can be made from this courthouse strategy. J. Curtis Edmondson, a Portland, Oregon, lawyer who is among the few who pushed back against a Strike 3 case and won, estimates that Strike 3 ""pulls in about $15 million to $20 million a year from its lawsuits."" That would make the cases ""way more profitable than selling their product....""   If only one-third of its more than 12,000 lawsuits produced settlements averaging as little as $5,000 each, the yield would come to $20 million...  The volume of Strike 3 cases has increased every year — from 1,932 in 2021 to 2,879 last year and 3,311 this year. 

What's really needed is a change in copyright law to bring the statutory damages down to a level that truly reflects the value of a film lost because of unauthorized downloading — not $750 or $150,000 but perhaps a few hundred dollars. 
Anone of the lawsuits go to trial.  Instead ISPs get a subpoena demanding the real-world address and name behind IP addresses ""ostensibly used to download content from BitTorrent..."" according to the article.  Strike 3 will then ""proceed by sending a letter implicitly threatening the subscriber with public exposure as a pornography viewer and explicitly with the statutory penalties for infringement written into federal copyright law — up to $150,000 for each example of willful infringement and from $750 to $30,0000 otherwise."" 

A federal judge in Connecticut wrote last year that  ""Given the nature of the films at issue, defendants may feel coerced to settle these suits merely to prevent public disclosure of their identifying information, even if they believe they have been misidentified.""

How Artists are Sabotaging AI to Take Revenge on Image Generators  (theconversation.com),https://theconversation.com/data-poisoning-how-artists-are-sabotaging-ai-to-take-revenge-on-image-generators-219335,"Some text-to-image generators ""have been trained by indiscriminately scraping online images,"" reports the Conversation, ""many of which may be under copyright. 

""Researchers who want to empower individual artists have recently created a tool named 'Nightshade' to fight back against unauthorised image scraping.""
The tool works by subtly altering an image's pixels in a way that wreaks havoc to computer vision but leaves the image unaltered to a human's eyes.... This can result in the algorithm mistakenly learning to classify an image as something a human would visually know to be untrue. As a result, the generator can start returning unpredictable and unintended results...   [A] balloon might become an egg. A request for an image in the style of Monet might instead return an image in the style of Picasso...  The models could also introduce other odd and illogical features to images — think six-legged dogs or deformed couches.  The higher the number of ""poisoned"" images in the training data, the greater the disruption. 

Because of how generative AI works, the damage from ""poisoned"" images also affects related prompt keywords.   For example, if a ""poisoned"" image of a Ferrari is used in training data, prompt results for other car brands and for other related terms, such as vehicle and automobile, can also be affected.   Nightshade's developer hopes the tool will make big tech companies more respectful of copyright, but it's also possible users could abuse the tool and intentionally upload ""poisoned"" images to generators to try and disrupt their services...  [Technological fixes] include the use of ""ensemble modeling"" where different models are trained on many different subsets of data and compared to locate specific outliers. This approach can be used not only for training but also to detect and discard suspected ""poisoned"" images.  Audits are another option. One audit approach involves developing a ""test battery"" — a small, highly curated, and well-labelled dataset — using ""hold-out"" data that are never used for training. This dataset can then be used to examine the model's accuracy. 


The article adds that the most obvious fix ""is paying greater attention to where input data are coming from and how they can be used. 

""Doing so would result in less indiscriminate data harvesting.  This approach does challenge a common belief among computer scientists: that data found online can be used for any purpose they see fit.""","on Sunday December 17, 2023 @07:56PM"
